# PHP Random User Agent Generator
Written in PHP, this script will generate real User Agent strings with optional capabilities to specify OS, Browser, Mobile, ect. simply by passing a parameter to the function called to generate the User Agent string. Created with the intentions of eliminating footprints while scraping the web for content using cURL because a truly solution to generate a truly random User Agent was not availble.

__Other Randomly Generated Segments__
* Version of Android with Device / build number strings, and variations of known UA's for specific devices.
* Version for iphone, ipad, or ipod from iOS 7-10
* Version of Windows from Windows Vista thru Windows 10
* Version of Chrome/Firefox/Safari for major versions that are still commonly used
* Randomly adds en-US; to some the user agents, as well as the U; flag

It's also easy to customize with random syntax parsing and random number generating, see `Customizing User Agent` below

# Usage Summary

Simply require `useragent.php` ( `require_once __DIR__.'/userAgent.php';` ) in the file where the User Agent string will be generated. 
Then initialize the class ( `$agent = new userAgent;` ). 
Finally, generate the User Agent by calling the `generate` function ( `$UAString = $agent->generate();` ). 
###### Note: `generate` can be called as many time as needed without having to initialize the class again.

## Example Usage 
```php 
$agent = new userAgent();
$agent->generate();
```

### or a one liner for one time use
```php
$userAgent = (new userAgent) ->generate();
```
***
## Example Usage when specifying a single OS, Browser, or Mobile
You can specify either `firefox`, `chrome`, `mobile`, `windows`, `mac`, `iphone`, `ipad`, `ipod`, and `android`.
```php
$agent = new userAgent();
$UAFireFox = $agent->generate('firefox'); // generates a firefox user agent on either windows or mac
$UAChrome = $agent->generate('chrome'); // generates a chrome user agent on either windows or mac
$UAMobile = $agent->generate('mobile'); // generates a mobile user agent for either iphone or android
$UAWindows = $agent->generate('windows'); // generates a windows user agent for either firefox or chrome
$UAMac = $agent->generate('mac'); // generates a mac user agent for either firefox or chrome
$UAiPhone = $agent->generate('iphone'); // generates an iphone user agent for iOS 7-10
$UAAndroid = $agent->generate('android'); // generates an android user agent for android versions 4.3-7.1, and includes randomly generated device and build number string that is correct for the version of android being displayed.
```

Customizing User Agent
===
You can edit the provided variables that the User Agent strings are generated from, using the syntax below to generate spun content.
**The syntax formatting works as shown below:**
```
$randomWindows = 'Windows; Windows 6.:number0-3:'; // :number0-3: will generate a number 0-3
$randomExample = 'Android [7.1|6.0|5.1]; Samsung Galaxy[ Note III| S6| S7|]'; // will choose a random android version 7.1, 6.0 or 5.1, and either Note III, S6, S7, or Nothing will be returned in the second option.  
```

#### NOTE: Nesting **is** supported in the random syntax 
---
```php
$version = 'Android [7.[1|0]|6.0|5.1]';// will work as expected
```

#### but nesting is **NOT** supported within the random number syntax
```php
$version = 'Android :number5-:number6-7::'; // will NOT return any number, and ':number5-:number6-7::' will be returned.
$version = 'Android :number4-7:.:number0-1:'; // will return numbers 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.1
```
